		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciStony1 = It's a rock.

		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciMetal1 = The sample appears to be a mix of ore and actual metal.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciMetal2 = You went through three drill bits collecting the sample. Maybe you shouldn't have picked the shiniest spot...
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciMetalKerbinLanded = You sneak off a sample before the asteroid's shinyness attracts too much attention.

		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCarbon1 = It's a blackish rock.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCarbon2 = You try to set the sample on fire, but nothing happens.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCarbonFlying = Getting this sample was easy; the whole asteroid is disintegrating.

		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcySample = Asteroid Sample
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcy1 = The ice is mixed in with reddish organic gunk. It's pretty gross.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcyFlying = You collect a sample in midair. The asteroid looks like it's about to explode!
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcySun1 = It's a miracle there's anything but rock left, and even that's sublimating.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcySun2 = It's a miracle there's anything but rock left.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcyMoho = It's a miracle there's anything but rock left.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcyEve = You can almost see the asteroid shrinking before your eyes. Your sample vanishes instantly.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcyKerbin = The asteroid is boiling furiously. You can't get a sample of anything solid.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcyMinmus = The asteroid is boiling furiously. Maybe you should get some of whatever keeps Minmus's surface from vaporizing.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcyDuna = You only get a sample of the organic bits as the ice vaporizes.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciIcyDres = Gases stream off the sample. Maybe you should put it in the icebox.

		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmtSample = Comet Sample
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmt1 = It's just rock. Maybe if you dug deeper?
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmt2 = You actually manage to find a pocket of pristine ice. Well, pristine-ish. Okay, it's actually pretty dirty.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmtFlying = You collect a sample in midair. The comet looks like it's about to explode!
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmtSun1 = The whole comet is sublimating. You might get a *gas* sample...
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmtSun2 = It's a miracle there's anything but rock left.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmtMoho = It's a miracle there's anything but rock left.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmtEve = You manage to sample a part that isn't blasting water into space.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmtKerbin = You manage to sample a part that isn't blasting water into space.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmtDuna1 = The comet has some scary-looking jets, but you manage to sneak an ice sample off its night side.
		#autoLOC_CustomAsteroids_SciCmtDuna2 = The rocky-looking bits appear unaffected by whatever's blasting jets out of the comet's surface.
